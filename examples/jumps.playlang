# This program simulates a simple for loop. #
0$ # We add a zero and save it to the register. # 
r # We set our return point. #
^1+$ # We load our register, add one to it, and save it. #
100<q # If the top of our stack is less than 5, we jump back to our restore point. #
e"Our value: "s^. # Load the saved value and pop it. #

# Our full program: 0$r^1+$100<qe"Our value: "s^. #
